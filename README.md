# TheFirstExhaustiveAnalysisOfEffects

Context: I challenge myself to committing long-term continuous work (arguably the most important life skill) at studying exhaustively the topic of Effects.

My criterion for exhaustiveness is: reading and summarizing the gist of ALL the articles from the de facto standard [List of Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_effects)

The choosen coverage order is alphabetical instead of hierachical.

see also my others attempts at exhaustively analysing Wikipedia: https://github.com/ExhaustiveAnalysisOfWikipediaTopics

Shall we begin:

# Medecine

[The Abscopal effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscopal_effect):

Something I strongly like about this topical overview of Effects is that it is extremelly inter-disciplinary.
  * A Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spread from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body.
  * A malignant Cancer is a group of diseases involving uncontrolled abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][8] These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.
 Eventually, (if no action is taken) malignant cancers becomes metastatic.
 
 The Abscopal effect is a kind of "Action at a Distance" (which surpeficially reminds of the Quantum concept). Basically when a tumor cell explode (e.g thanks to radiations) it leaks some cells internals that are recodnized by surrounding immunitary cells as malignant, then those activated antigens flow through the body (via blood) and can detect distant cancer cells (at least thats the theory). Hence the Abscopal Effect shows that a local cure can act as a non-local cure for cancer. This make this effect a potential holy grail of medecine, however in practice it is only rarely observed because e.g the radiation often destroy the surrounding antigen cells before they can spread, hence an optimal ratio dose (with combined antigen drugs) must be found empirically (and ineptly has not yet been found despite being apparently a trivial logistic regression, as always the fact that there is no centralised place for tracking specific science progress (github-like) does not help) <br />My neophyte guess is that: if some internals of a cancerous cell, once leaked, acts as a pseudo-vaccine on specific immune cells, then why isn't this process collected in the patient, cultivated and injected in masse, in critical areas ? That would be much less ad-hoc, more effective, and allow for stronger radiations while preserving the Abscopal Effect.

## Vision

[The Kinetic Depth Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_depth_effect):
It both denote the way that the brain is able to infer a 3D structure/depth from movement alone and its associated optical illusion (perceiving in 2D images (in motion) in 3D)
The best is [to experience it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_depth_effect), additionally the direction of the movement can freely change between a few watches.

[Autokinetic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokinetic_effect):
This other effect make you see motion when there is not, i.e it is an effect in wich *a stationary, small point of light in an otherwise dark or featureless environment appears to move.*
explanation: *It is presumed to occur because motion perception is always relative to some reference point, and in darkness or in a featureless environment there is no reference point, so the position of the single point is undefined.*
This effect explain a lot of weird visions in a lot of domains such as many "UFOs" when looking at the starts (I have experienced myself autokinetic stars in Corsica and can now retro-understand it)

# Physics
## Radiations
[Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation): 
Mind Blowing, radiations can go Faster Than Light in some common materials! <br/>
[Askaryan radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askaryan_radiation):
A subset of Cherenkov radiations produce Askaryan radiations as a side effect, which make them detectable in some common spectrum (e.g. radio)
This might help neutrinos detections.
