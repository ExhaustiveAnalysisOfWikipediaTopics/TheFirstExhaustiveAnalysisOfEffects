# TheFirstExhaustiveAnalysisOfEffects

Context: I challenge myself to committing long-term continuous work (arguably the most important life skill) at studying exhaustively the topic of Effects.

My criterion for exhaustiveness is: reading and summarizing the gist of ALL the articles from the de facto standard [List of Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_effects)

The choosen coverage order is alphabetical instead of hierachical.

see also my others attempts at exhaustively analysing Wikipedia: https://github.com/ExhaustiveAnalysisOfWikipediaTopics

Shall we begin:

[The Abscopal effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscopal_effect):

Something I strongly like about this topical overview of Effects is that it is extremelly inter-disciplinary.
  * A Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spread from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body.
  * A malignant Cancer is a group of diseases involving uncontrolled abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][8] These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.
 Eventually, (if no action is taken) malignant cancers becomes metastatic.
 
 The Abscopal effect is a kind of "Action at a Distance" (which surpeficially reminds of the Quantum concept). Basically when a tumor cell explode (e.g thanks to radiations) it leaks some cells internals that are recodnized by surrounding immunitary cells as malignant, then those activated antigens flow through the body (via blood) and can detect distant cancer cells (at least thats the theory). Hence the Abscopal Effect shows that a local cure can act as a non-local cure for cancer. This make this effect a potential holy grail of medecine, however in practice it is only rarely observed because e.g the radiation often destroy the surrounding antigen cells before they can spread, hence an optimal ratio dose (with combined antigen drugs) must be found empirically (and ineptly has not yet been found despite being apparently a trivial logistic regression, as always the fact that there is no centralised place for tracking specific science progress (github-like) does not help)
My neophyte guess is that: if some internals of a cancerous cell, once leaked, acts as a pseudo-vaccine on specific immune cells, then why isn't this process collected in the patient, cultivated and injected in masse, in critical areas ? That would be much less ad-hoc, more effective, and allow for stronger radiations while preserving the Abscopal Effect.
In summary: intellectually interesting 15/20 however niche 5/20
